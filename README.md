# Disblock Origin

An ad-blocker "Theme" for Discord that hides all Nitro and "boost" upsells, alongside some annoyances.


## Installation

Use your favorite client mod (such as Vencord) to add the theme. You can copy the direct URL here:
```
https://codeberg.org/AllPurposeMat/Disblock-Origin/raw/branch/master/DisblockOrigin.theme.css
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are certain optional features at the end of the CSS you can change by uncommenting them. I am exploring ways to make these more accessible without having to change the CSS, but well here we are for now.
