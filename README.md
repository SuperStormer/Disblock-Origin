# Disblock Origin

An ad-blocker "Theme" for Discord that hides all Nitro and "boost" upsells, alongside some annoyances.


## Installation

Use your favorite client mod (such as Vencord) to add the theme. You can use this URL, which mirrors the files on the repo:
```
https://allpurposem.at/disblock/DisblockOrigin.theme.css
```

> [!NOTE]
> It's possible to toggle certain features by overriding settings listed at the top of the `theme.css`. To do so, copy the `:root` block from the `theme.css` and paste it into **Local Themes** > **Edit QuickCSS**. You can then adjust the values to your liking as described in the comment above it. Alternatively, you can create a new `:root` block in the QuickCSS and add only the settings you want to change.


To see whether Disblock Origin is properly installed, check for the logo at the bottom of the settings sidebar next to Discord's social logos, you should see a mauve Disblock Origin logo to let you know it's working.
